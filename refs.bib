In configuration, it is also slowly changing from cartesian and cylindrical coordinate types to articulated one mainly due to the fact that articulated robot arms are more flexible and versatile.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new scheme for redundancy control of robot manipulators. We introduce the concept of task priority in relation to the inverse kinematic problem of redundant robot manipulators. A required task is divided into subtasks according to the order of priority. We propose to determine the joint motions of robot manipulators so that subtasks with lower priority can be performed utilizing redundancy on subtasks with higher priority. This procedure is formulated using the pseudoinverses of Jacobian matrices. Most problems of redundancy utilization can be formulated in the framework of tasks with the order of priority. The results ofnumerical simulations and experiments show the effectiveness ofthe proposed redundancy control scheme.},

First, issues related to thedescription of end-effector tasks that involve constrained motion and active force control are discussed. Thefundamentals of the operational space formulation are thenpresented, andthe unified approach for motion and force control is developed. The extension of this formulation to redundant manipulator systems is also presented,constructing the end-effector equations of motion and describing their behavior with respect to joint forces. These results are used in thedevelopment of a new and systematic approachfor dealing with the problems arising at kinematic singularitiesA. t a singular configuration, the manipulator is treated as a mechanismthat is redundant with respect to the motion of the end-effector in the subspace of operational space orthogonal to the singular direction.},

  abstract = {Practical application of the task-priority redundancy resolution technique must deal with the occurrence of kinematic and algorithmic singularities. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, the application of existing singularity-robust methods to the case of kinematically redundant arms is studied. Then, a new task-priority redundancy resolution technique is developed that overcomes the effects of algorithmic singularities. Computational aspects of the solutions are also considered in view of real-time implementation of a kinematic control algorithm. The method is applied to a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator in numerical case studies to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {With the increasing complexity of humanoid mechanisms and their desired capabilities, there is a pressing need for a generalized framework where a desired whole-body motion behavior can be easily specified and controlled. Our hypothesis is that human motion results from simultaneously performing multiple objectives in a hierarchical manner, and we have analogously developed a prioritized, multiple-task control framework. The operational space formulation               10               provides dynamic models at the task level and structures for decoupled task and posture control.               13               This formulation allows for posture objectives to be controlled without dynamically interfering with the operational task. Achieving higher performance of posture objectives requires precise models of their dynamic behaviors. In this paper we complete the picture of task descriptions and whole-body dynamic control by establishing models of the dynamic behavior of secondary task objectives within the posture space. Using these models, we present a whole-body control framework that decouples the interaction between the task and postural objectives and compensates for the dynamics in their respective spaces.},

  abstract = {To synthesize whole-body behaviors interactively, multiple behavioral primitives need to be simultaneously controlled, including those that guarantee that the constraints imposed by the robot's structure and the external environment are satisfied. Behavioral primitives are entities for the control of various movement criteria, e.g. primitives describing the behavior of the center of gravity, the behaviors of the hands, legs, and head, the body attitude and posture, the constrained body parts such as joint-limits and contacts, etc. By aggregating multiple primitives, we synthesize whole-body behaviors. For safety and for efficient control, we establish a control hierarchy among behavioral primitives, which is exploited to establish control priorities among the different control categories, i.e. constraints, operational tasks, and postures. Constraints should always be guaranteed, while operational tasks should be accomplished without violating the acting constraints, and the posture should control the residual movement redundancy. In this paper, we will present a multi-level hierarchical control structure that allows the establishment of general priorities among behavioral primitives, and we will describe compliant control strategies for efficient control under contact interactions.},
