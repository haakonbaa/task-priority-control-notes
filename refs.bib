  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new scheme for redundancy control of robot manipulators. We introduce the concept of task priority in relation to the inverse kinematic problem of redundant robot manipulators. A required task is divided into subtasks according to the order of priority. We propose to determine the joint motions of robot manipulators so that subtasks with lower priority can be performed utilizing redundancy on subtasks with higher priority. This procedure is formulated using the pseudoinverses of Jacobian matrices. Most problems of redundancy utilization can be formulated in the framework of tasks with the order of priority. The results ofnumerical simulations and experiments show the effectiveness ofthe proposed redundancy control scheme.},

  abstract = {A framework for the analysis and control of manipulator systemswithrespect to the dynamicbehavior of their end-effectors is developed. First, issues related to thedescription of end-effector tasks that involve constrained motion and active force control are discussed. Thefundamentals of the operational space formulation are thenpresented, andthe unified approach for motion and force control is developed. The extension of this formulation to redundant manipulator systems is also presented,constructing the end-effector equations of motion and describing their behavior with respect to joint forces. These results are used in thedevelopment of a new and systematic approachfor dealing with the problems arising at kinematic singularitiesA. t a singular configuration, the manipulator is treated as a mechanismthat is redundant with respect to the motion of the end-effector in the subspace of operational space orthogonal to the singular direction.},
