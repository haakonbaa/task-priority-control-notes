  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new scheme for redundancy control of robot manipulators. We introduce the concept of task priority in relation to the inverse kinematic problem of redundant robot manipulators. A required task is divided into subtasks according to the order of priority. We propose to determine the joint motions of robot manipulators so that subtasks with lower priority can be performed utilizing redundancy on subtasks with higher priority. This procedure is formulated using the pseudoinverses of Jacobian matrices. Most problems of redundancy utilization can be formulated in the framework of tasks with the order of priority. The results ofnumerical simulations and experiments show the effectiveness ofthe proposed redundancy control scheme.},
